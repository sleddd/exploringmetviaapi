=== Exploring The Met via API === \
A sandbox app began to test out the The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Open Access API.
https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess

It lets you navigate through the available artifacts one object at a time. Each object is randomly selected and there are approximately 470,000 objects available. Objects with images that have rights restricted are not available for download and cannot be shown. A link back to the the Met object detail page is provided for each object. Often rights restricted and additional images as well as more detailed information can be found there. The Met also has a great catalog interface to search and explore the full Met Collection at: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection

This little test app was originally started on CodePen and migrated to git for safe keeping and any potential future updates. It is now kept on Codesandbox.
