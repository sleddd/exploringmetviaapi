This small test app lets you navigate through the available Metropolitan Museum of Art artifacts one random object at a time. Consider it a 365 day slideshow for art history buffs, a random tour, or an art history pop-quiz! It's all in how you interpret it. There are approximately 470,000 objects available. Objects with images that have rights restricted are not available for download and cannot be shown. In these cases, a link back to the the Met object detail page is provided. From thier website, you can view more detailed information, and in some cases, where applicable, the rights restricted images.

Originally created to test The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Open Access API, I have kept it and made it publically available for anyone to use via CodeSandbox.
